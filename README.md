# CommitViewer

CommitViewer is a very prototypical application to view how merges were made. If you have version A and version B and merge them together, you will see the differences between version A and version B in the left window. You will see the solved version, with an attempt to strip out irrelevant information, on the right. 

All you have to do is put your repository location in Main.java. In the place where there is currently a git repo path. Meh, you'll figure it out.

This is the type of code that you branch and modify to fit your needs. It is not perfect, but it gets the job done for me
